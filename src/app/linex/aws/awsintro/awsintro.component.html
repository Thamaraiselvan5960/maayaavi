		<h1>WHERE TO START LEARNING AWS?</h1>
		<p>The three areas you should focus on when starting AWS are:</p>
		<li>TIP 1: LEARN CORE AWS SERVICES FIRST</li>
		<li>TIP 2: GET HANDS ON WITH AWS</li>
		<li>PART 3: STRUCTURE YOUR AWS LEARNING</li>

	<h1>TIP 1: LEARN CORE AWS SERVICES FIRST</h1>
	<p>First Learn one service in aws.Then you can easily understand other services easily.here is the most commonly used service in AWS.</p>
	<h1>ECS</h1>
	<p>ECS runs your containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) virtual machine instances pre-installed with Docker. It handles installing containers, scaling, monitoring, and managing these instances through both an API and the AWS Management Console</p>
	<p>The core services are: EC2, IAM and S3.</p>
	<mat-card class="warning">
		<p>WHAT OTHER AWS SERVICES SHOULD YOU KEEP AN EYE ON?</p>
		<li><b>CloudWatch</b> — The built-in AWS monitoring tool.</li>

	<h1>PART 3: STRUCTURE YOUR AWS LEARNING</h1>
	<p>And the last of my three tips for today is to structure your learning. If you don’t structure your learning, you risk getting lost in a sea of details and spending more time learning unnecessary areas whilst neglecting the right ones. But how do we add that structure to our learning?</p>

	<p>One of the best ways to add that structure is to take a look at the different AWS exams. Now, I know what you’re thinking: I don’t know the first thing about AWS, so why would I take an exam? And that’s a fair challenge, but let me explain why the exams are a great logical starting point.</p>

	<p>AWS has done a lot of thinking about their exams, and as a result they’ve created a really useful structure. The exams start with foundational skills before becoming specialised in different areas. Which makes them a good reference to structure your learning on. Let’s me show you what I mean, and take a look at the various different exams…</p>
