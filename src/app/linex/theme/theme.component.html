		<mat-card>
				<p>Color theory is the collection of rules and guidelines which designers use to communicate with users through appealing color schemes in visual interfaces. To pick the best colors every time, designers use a color wheel and refer to extensive collected knowledge about human optical ability, psychology, culture and more.</p>
				<h1>Color Category</h1>
				<mat-card>
					<li>Primary (red, blue, yellow)</li>
					<li>Secondary (mixes of primary colors)</li>
					<li>Tertiary (or intermediate – mixes of primary and secondary colors).for example, mixing blue (primary) and violet (secondary) creates blue-violet (tertiary).</li>
				</mat-card>
				<p>A color’s properties are:

				<li>Hue – How it appears (e.g., “is green”).</li>
				<li>Chroma – How pure it is: i.e., if it has shades (black added), tints (white added) or tones (grey added).You might be seeing a tint (a color with white added to it), a shade (a color with black added to it), or a tone (a color with grey added to it).</li>
				<li>Lighting – How pale or saturated it appears.you could be seeing an oversaturated or desaturated color. The saturation of a color is how bright or dull the color is.</li></p>
		</mat-card>
		<mat-card class='card-color'>
			<p>When starting your design process, you can consider using any of these <b>main color schemes:</b></p>
			<li>Monochromatic – Take one hue and create other elements from different shades and tints of it.</li>
			<li>Analogous – Use three colors located beside one another on the color wheel (e.g., orange, yellow-orange and yellow to show sunlight). A variant is to mix white with these to form a “high-key” analogous color scheme (e.g., flames).</li>
			<li>Complementary – Use “opposite color” pairs—e.g., blue/yellow—to maximize contrast.</li>
			<li>Split-Complementary (or Compound Harmony) – Add colors from either side of your complementary color pair to soften contrast.</li>
			<li>Triadic – Take three colors which are equally distant on the color wheel (i.e., 120° apart: e.g., red/blue/yellow). These colors may not be vibrant, but the scheme can be as it maintains harmony and high contrast. It’s easier to make visually appealing designs with this than with a complementary scheme.</li>
			<li>Tetradic – Take four colors that are two sets of complementary pairs (e.g., orange/yellow/blue/violet) and choose one dominant color. This allows rich, interesting designs. However, watch the balance between warm and cool colors.</li>
			<li>Square – A variant of tetradic; you find four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (i.e., 90° apart). Unlike tetradic, square schemes can work well if you use all four colors evenly.</li>
			<p><b>Your colors must reflect your design’s goal and brand’s personality.</b> You should also apply color theory to optimize a positive psychological impact on users. So, you should carefully determine how the color temperature (i.e., your use of warm, neutral and cool colors) reflects your message. For example, you can make a neutral color such as grey warm or cool depending on factors such as your organization’s character and the industry.</p>

		<mat-toolbar [style.background-color] = "titlebg">Keep it simple</mat-toolbar>
		<mat-card class='card-color'>
			<p>This might seem like it could get complicated, but it shouldn't. Instead, when choosing your color scheme, think about simplicity. A really complicated, busy color scheme often confuses the eye.</p>

			<p>Keeping things simple has two big benefits.</p>

			<p>Perhaps the biggest benefit is that simplicity can effortlessly tie together a color scheme. If you have just a few colors at work, everything will look unified. (Well, at least if you’ve used one of the color combinations mentioned above.)</p>

			<p>Another benefit is that viewers don’t have to work hard to process what’s going on. That’s one of the hallmarks of a great website. If you go overboard on the color, your users will be more confused.</p>

			<p>WordStream’s color scheme is a great example. The homepage uses just three colors: blue, orange, and a splash of green.</p>

			<p>WordStream's website color scheme</p>
			<p>Blue and orange are the central colors here, with the page being dominated by different shades of blue. The orange is used for the call to action, and since orange is blue’s complement, the button stands out and draws the eye.</p>

		<mat-toolbar [style.background-color] = "titlebg">Contrast your colors</mat-toolbar>
		<mat-card class='card-color'>
			<p>Next, think about contrast. It’s one of the most important elements of good design you can use when creating your website color scheme.</p>

			<p>That’s because contrast creates impact.</p>

		<mat-toolbar [style.background-color] = "titlebg">6. Integrate your branding</mat-toolbar>
		<mat-card class='card-color'>
			<p>Finally, consider how your branding will play into your color scheme. Chances are your brand already has certain colors associated with it. If that’s the case, you can use your existing color palette to help create your website color scheme.</p>
			<p>However, you may need to tweak your brand colors. If one of the colors you’ve chosen has a negative meaning, you might want to choose a different color.</p>
			<p>That’s the key here—think about the color associations that people have with the colors you’ve chosen. Are these associations consistent with the values that you’ve built your brand on?</p>
